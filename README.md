# 🧠 Project: Child Mind Institute - Data Storytelling

> **Topic:** Child Mental Health & Behavioral Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Group 1** repository. This project focuses on processing and visualizing data from the **Child Mind Institute** to uncover critical insights regarding child mental health.

## 📖 Introduction

In this project, we analyze datasets related to children's behavior and physiological indicators (such as sleep patterns and physical activity). Our main goal is to transform raw data into valuable information through a Data Science pipeline.

Key steps include:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, noise, and reformatting structures.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating data distribution characteristics.
3.  **Visualization:** Building charts to illustrate correlations between various factors.

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Build an effective Data Preprocessing pipeline.
* ✅ Visualize data clearly to support decision-making.
* ✅ Detect patterns related to child health and behavior.
* ✅ Practice teamwork and source code management with Git.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 🐍
* **Data Processing:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 💡 Our Approach

To address the challenges of this dataset, our team applied the following process:

1.  **Data Cleaning Strategy:**
    * Handling missing values using specific methods (e.g., Interpolation / Mean Imputation).
    * Removing outliers and normalizing time-series data formats.

2.  **Analysis & Visualization Techniques:**
    * Using **Correlation Heatmaps** to detect relationships between behavioral indicators.
    * Using **Time-series Charts** to track trends over time.
    * Applying **Distribution plots** to assess data skewness.

3.  **Deriving Insights:**
    * Synthesizing key findings from charts to draw conclusions on specific behaviors (e.g., sleep habits, internet usage).
